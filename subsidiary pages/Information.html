<h2>Thuthuzela Care Centre operations: How does the TCC work?</h2>
<p><strong>Step1:</strong> You can report a rape case directly to a TCC(based at community clinics or hospitals) or to a police station<br>
    <strong>Step2:</strong> TCC staff will assist to get you immediate medical attention at the Centre<br/>
	<strong>Step3:</strong> TCC staff will arrange counselling services at the Centre<br>
	<strong>Step4:</strong> TCC staff will assist you to open a police case (if you want to do so immeadiately or even at a later stage)<br>
	<strong>Step5:</strong> TCC staff will arrange for on-going counselling and court preparation (if the case goes on trial)
