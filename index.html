<p><em><u><h3>Background Of Our Campaign</em></p></u>
<p><em><i> Thuthuzela is a Non-Profit organisation that was initiated in the year of 2003, with the sole purpose of dealing with social issues within our communities all around South Africa.<br/>
We have been successful in changing lives and bringing a change to many victims who have experienced Abuse, Rape, Gender-Based and other forms of violence. 
One of many Thuthuzela service centres is the one based in Galeshewe, specifically Day Hospital. Thuthuzela service centres are found all over the country of South Africa
and have a large/fluctuant number of victims and survivors who report these gruesome experiences and seek for emotional and physical support from people that they know they are able to trust.
As a result of the lack of support from the government, Thuthuzela will always continue to tackle socio-economic issues that affect our people and society.
As Mrs Zandile(our source of information) said, helping the victim is not the end of the challenge, but rather helping/treating both the perpertrator and the victim and coming to the root of the problem
 is the best way to decrease the continuous occurence of such dehumanising cases/issues.
<br/>
<p> We do urge any victims to report to us on our helplines, and our e-mail adresses and other relevant contact details which are open and free to call at any time of the day.</p>
